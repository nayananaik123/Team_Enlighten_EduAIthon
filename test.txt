Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. These machines can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Some key applications of AI include natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a type of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns in data.
